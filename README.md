## Overview

**PICA (Python-based Instrument Control and Automation)** is a software suite designed to provide a robust framework for automating laboratory instruments in materials science and condensed matter physics research. The suite features a central graphical user interface (GUI), the **PICA Launcher**, which serves as a dashboard for managing and executing a variety of characterization experiments.

A key architectural feature is the use of isolated process execution for each measurement module via Python's `multiprocessing` library, ensuring high stability and preventing inter-script conflicts. This platform is built to streamline data acquisition, enhance experimental reproducibility, and accelerate research workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python:** Python 3.9 or newer is recommended.
2.  **NI-VISA Driver:** You must install the [National Instruments VISA Driver](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-visa.html) for your operating system. This is required for Python's `pyvisa` library to communicate with the instruments.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prathameshnium/PICA-Python-Instrument-Control-and-Automation.git
    cd PICA-Python-Instrument-Control-and-Automation
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    
    # Activate the environment
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    This project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage all necessary packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Launch the Application**
    Execute the main launcher script from the project's root directory.
    ```bash
    python PICA_Launcher_V5.py
    ```
