# PICA: Python Instrument Control & Automation

PICA is a collection of practical, ready-to-use Python scripts for controlling and automating common electrical and thermal characterization experiments in materials science and physics research. Each folder contains the necessary control logic and GUI for a specific measurement setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Dependencies
To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages.

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/prathameshnium/PICA-Python-Instrument-Control-and-Automation.git](https://github.com/prathameshnium/PICA-Python-Instrument-Control-and-Automation.git)
cd PICA-Python-Instrument-Control-and-Automation
````

**Install the core dependencies:**
This project relies on a few key packages. Ensure they are installed in your Python environment.

```bash
pip install pyvisa pymeasure numpy pandas
```

## üöÄ Usage

Each directory is a self-contained measurement system. To run an experiment, navigate into the desired folder and execute the main Python script.

For example, to start the Low Resistance I-V measurement:

```bash
cd "Low Resistance (Delta Mode)"
python low_resistance_gui.py
```

*(Note: Script names may vary. Please see the specific folder for details.)*
