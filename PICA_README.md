## Overview

**PICA (Python-based Instrument Control and Automation)** is a software suite designed to provide a robust framework for automating laboratory instruments in materials science and condensed matter physics research. The suite features a central graphical user interface (GUI), the **PICA Launcher**, which serves as a dashboard for managing and executing a variety of characterization experiments.

A key architectural feature is the use of isolated process execution for each measurement module via Python's `multiprocessing` library, ensuring high stability and preventing inter-script conflicts. This platform is built to streamline data acquisition, enhance experimental reproducibility, and accelerate research workflows.

PICA is designed with a clear separation between the user interface (frontend) and the instrument control logic (backend). This modular approach makes the system easy to maintain, extend, and debug.

## Architecture

The core design philosophy of PICA is the separation of concerns, implemented through a distinct **Frontend-Backend** architecture for each measurement module.

-   **Frontend:** Each measurement has a dedicated GUI script (e.g., `IV_K2400_Frontend_v5.py`) built with `Tkinter`. It is responsible for all user interaction, parameter input, and data visualization (live plotting). It runs in the main process.

-   **Backend:** The instrument control logic is encapsulated in a separate class (e.g., `Keithley2400_Backend`). This class handles all `PyVISA` communication, instrument configuration, and data acquisition commands.

-   **Process Isolation:** When a measurement is started, the frontend launches its corresponding backend logic in a separate, isolated process using Python's `multiprocessing` library. This is the key to PICA's stability: a crash or error in one measurement script will not affect the main launcher or any other running experiments.

-   **Communication:** The frontend and backend communicate via `multiprocessing.Queue` for thread-safe data exchange. The backend performs a measurement and places the data into a queue, which the frontend then reads to update plots and save to a file.
