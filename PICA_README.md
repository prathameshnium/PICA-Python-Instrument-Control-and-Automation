## Overview

**PICA (Python-based Instrument Control and Automation)** is a software suite designed to provide a robust framework for automating laboratory instruments in materials science and condensed matter physics research. The suite features a central graphical user interface (GUI), the **PICA Launcher**, which serves as a dashboard for managing and executing a variety of characterization experiments.

A key architectural feature is the use of isolated process execution for each measurement module via Python's `multiprocessing` library, ensuring high stability and preventing inter-script conflicts. This platform is built to streamline data acquisition, enhance experimental reproducibility, and accelerate research workflows.

## Core Features

- **Centralized Control Dashboard:** A comprehensive GUI for launching all measurement modules.
- **Isolated Process Execution:** Each script operates in a discrete process, guaranteeing application stability and preventing resource conflicts.
- **Integrated VISA Instrument Scanner:** An embedded utility for discovering, identifying, and troubleshooting GPIB/VISA instrument connections.
- **Modular Architecture:** Each experimental setup is encapsulated in a self-contained module with direct access to its scripts and data directories.
- **Embedded Documentation:** In-application viewer for essential project documentation, such as this README and the software license.
- **System Console Log:** A real-time log provides status updates, confirmations, and error diagnostics for all operations.
